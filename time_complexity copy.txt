This is a document to make calculations on time complexity of word_analogy.py

1) It is around ~20k (10^4) word-sets in Google Test Set
2) It is around ~900 (10^3) words in vector_model.txt
3) it is 300 vector values for each vector

GOAL: 10^7 = 10 seconds
NOW: ~1000 * 300 = 300,000 (10^5) * (10^4) = (10^9) / (10^7) = (10^2) = 100 seconds

UPDATE: Full scan using Euclidean distance without normalizing finished in 98s on Mac machine
        General Accuracy = 14.217827

UPDATE: Full scan using Manhattan distance without normalizing finished in 186 on Mac machine
        General Accuracy = 14.34

UPDATE: Full scan using Cosine distance without normalizing finished in 654 on Mac machine
        General Accuracy = 14.217827
